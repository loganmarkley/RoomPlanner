# Room Planner!
Using Python and the pygame library, I plan to make a fully functioning room planner! It will be blueprint style in which you have an overhead view, and you can change the size of the walls, add vertices to your walls to make them exactly how your room is, and even add furniture. You can resize everything, rotate furniture, and more.

Current Features:
* Real-time wall and furniture dimensions
* 10 unique pieces of custom-made furniture
* Resizeable walls and furniture
* Individually scaleable lengths and widths of furniture pieces
* Walls and furniture pieces will "snap" to vertical and horizontal positions
* Add or delete corners with a single click
* Add or delete furniture with a single click
* Toggleable background grid

## Date Started: 8/2/2023
This is probably the biggest project that I have taken on so far, with my website being a close second. I am very excited to progress through the development!
